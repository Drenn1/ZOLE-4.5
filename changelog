Update 1

- Bugfix: Editing some enemies (such as 7000, the d1 miniboss) would cause 
them to crash. This is fixed, all enemies should be editable now.

- Bugfix: Using multiple random-enemy interactions in a row did not work 
before and could cause the game to crash.

Update 2

- One of Lin's patches involving VRAM transfers has been modified, in order to 
work properly on a real gameboy without graphical corruption. Click "Re-apply 
ASM patches" to apply it to an already modified rom.

- A new ASM patch, "Extra Interaction Bank", has been added for both Ages and 
Seasons. If you encounter an error saying that there is no free space left
when you try to add an interaction, apply this patch and you're good to go.

- The freespace management for interactions has been improved in general.

Update 3

- Quadruple-value interactions have their values labelled correctly now (their
ID field was previously wrong)
- Item drops (interaction $a) have their values labelled correctly. To use one,
create it and put it over a bush or pot to make a guaranteed item drop.
